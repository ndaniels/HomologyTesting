* come up with a better naming/organization system for temporary files in
* alignment-test and query-negative-controls, capture output from smurf and
  matt and act on segmentation faults
* note that the whitelist is only necessary for a more recent version of the
  Matt code: it refuses to run with any chains with less than 5 residues...
* remove duplicate code among generate-positive-controls.py and
  generate-negative-controls.py
* change the argument parser for generate-csv.py: the 'output_dir' is really
  an input_dir in this script
